                    <h3>Apple 1</h3>
                    <p>Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, which led to the formation of Apple Computer in 1976.</p>

                    <h3>Apple 2</h3>
                    <p>The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[81] designed primarily by Wozniak (Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case[240] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply[79]). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak and was the first consumer product sold by Apple.</p>

                    <h3>Macintosh</h3>

This was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.</p>

                        The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.
